# Quantum Imaging using Complex Degree of Coherence

Documentation and code repository for the PH 202 course project. The final submission can be viewed [here](https://github.com/loqm/PH202_2020). The results are presented in the form of an interactive Jupyter notebook, also referred to as an executable paper.

In an ‘executable paper’, authors have the ability to embed chunks of executable code and data into their papers, and readers may execute that code within the framework of the research article. The executable paper combines the narrative of a traditional scholarly paper with embedded computational experiments that run chunks of code on prespecified or interactively provided datasets, producing verifiable results.
